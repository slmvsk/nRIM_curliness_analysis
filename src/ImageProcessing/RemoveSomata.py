# yes it is for 0ne scene only, but all my functions will be for 1 scene and then 
# I will just iterate over all of the scenes and files?????????????????
#or make a function that will iterates for files but not scenes, that will 
# be already made for scenes 
# it is also a question that i will release memory after each scene or after each file?

# Example usage
# Assume `image_stack` is your 3D numpy array with shape [height, width, depth]
# `xy_resolution` is a parameter that you might use to adjust algorithm behavior based on image resolution
